### Build with:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Qeries

### What I learned:
I learned how to structure a file semantically in html, using classes with proper names for their tags. I fixed some knowledge in flexbox, padding, margin. I learned new properties like line-height. 

### Continued development:
I want to continue programming until I can fix all the necessary knowledge to be able to codar without so much help.
